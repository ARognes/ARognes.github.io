		<h1>Collins Aerospace: Simultaneous Call Transmission</h1>
		<h2>January 2022 - December 2022</h2>
		<span>A team of 2 software engineers and 3 electrical engineers are building a machine learning model to detect when multiple radio signals are being read through an air traffic controller radio using Python and TensorFlow. We made a radio simulation using Matlab and Simulink and setup a continuous integration GitLab pipeline to generate new training data on each push.

		<h1>Equipment-Record</h1>
		<h2>August 2021 - March 2022</h2>
		<span>This is a Firebase/Sveltekit web app that tracks construction equipment between job sites using QR-codes, barcodes, or any text id. Many companies use their own highly specialized, internally built QR-code tracking application. This implementation is specialized for construction equipment. Equipment may be checked in or out by scanning the correct QR-code with the correct privileges. Foremen delegate these privileges to their workers and all equipment movement may be tracked and recorded for further analysis. Truckers can also be delegated to transport equipment from job site to job site at some specific time. <br><br> This gives a clear image of where equipment gets lost. This also has the advantage of responsibility tracking and overall better equipment info for everyone in the company <br> Check it out! <a href="https://app.equipment-record.com">app.equipment-record.com</a> <br>Username: arst@arst.ars <br>Password: arstARST1234!@#$

		<h1>AlgoGrid</h1>
		<h2>December 2019 - Janary 2020</h2>
		<span>A JavaScript implementation of an interactive algorithm visualizer. It runs an A* search algorithm as well as Conway's Game of Life. A few features have broken since it was written unfortunately so I've reverted it to an older commit. <br>There are buttons on the bottom left to select the tool to use. The three little grey buttons allow you to select which algorithm you are using. <br>Check it out! <a href="https://arognes.com/AlgoGrid">arognes.com/AlgoGrid</a>

      <span>
        A web-app that keeps track of construction equipment through QR-code, barcode, or unique name.
        This allows for better understanding and tracking of equimpent throughout job sites. 
        It also improves knowledge of ownership and gives insight into where and how equipment is lost.

        A 42 key, bluetooth keyboard with at least 100mAh battery life per side. 
        You can even snap off the 3 pinky keys for 36 keys if you're that far gone!
        This project is currently waiting on assembly of Prototype V0.2 to continue.
        This is more of a hardware project but I just love making things.

"Collins Aerospace: Simultaneous Call Transmission":
  description: >
    A team of 2 software engineers and 3 electrical engineers are building a machine learning model to detect when multiple
    radio signals are being read through an air traffic controller radio using Python and TensorFlow. We made a radio simulation
    using Matlab and Simulink and setup a continuous integration GitLab pipeline to generate new training data on each push.

Equipment-Record:
  description: >
    This is a Firebase/Sveltekit web app that tracks construction equipment between job sites using QR-codes, barcodes, or any text id.
    Many companies use their own highly specialized, internally built QR-code tracking application. This implementation is specialized
    for construction equipment. Equipment may be checked in or out by scanning the correct QR-code with the correct privileges.
    Foremen delegate these privileges to their workers and all equipment movement may be tracked and recorded for further analysis.
    Truckers can also be delegated to transport equipment from job site to job site at some specific time.
    <br><br>
    This gives a clear image of where equipment gets lost. This also has the advantage of responsibility tracking and overall better
    equipment info for everyone in the company

AlgoGrid:
  description: >
    A JavaScript implementation of an interactive algorithm visualizer.
    It runs an A* search algorithm as well as Conway's Game of Life.
    A few features have broken since it was written unfortunately so I've reverted it to an older commit.
    <br>There are buttons on the bottom left to select the tool to use.
    The three little grey buttons allow you to select which algorithm you are using.
    <br>Check it out! <a href="https://arognes.com/AlgoGrid">arognes.com/AlgoGrid</a>
